The application is written and tested in the IntelliJ IDEA.

The business tier is split into separate services running on their own servers.
Services communicate through HTTP requests.
The project will come in the form of 4 separate modules within the project folder:
 - FlagService
 - GameService
 - PlayerService
 - RoomService

The run configuration for the test suite is stored in 'Run_Business_Tier_Tests.xml'
To run these tests, ensure the included 'runConfigurations' folder copied into the top-level '.idea' folder in the project directory.
Run this suite using the Run Configuration dropdown on the top-right of the IDEA.

The test suite is a manually written suite of tests that runs on the client-server interface.
The suite file is configured to be in the GameService module in the same folder as GameServiceApplication.java 
  (Capture_The_Flag_Game/GameService/src/main/java/edu/uwb/css533/service/)
A brief summary of the test results will be printed upon successful completion of the test suite.
